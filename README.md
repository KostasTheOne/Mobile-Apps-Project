📱 Mobile Apps Data Analysis Project

This project is inspired by one of the guided projects from DataQuest, with some modifications and extensions. In this version, I primarily use the pandas library to perform data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.

📌 Project Overview

In this project, we assume the role of data analysts working for a company that develops mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms. The company publishes its apps on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

All apps developed by the company are:

Free to download and install

Monetized through in-app advertisements

As a result, the company’s revenue depends heavily on the number of users per app — the more users an app attracts, the higher the potential ad revenue.

🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to analyze mobile app data in order to help developers understand:

What types of apps are more likely to attract a large number of users

Which categories and genres are most popular on Android and iOS

These insights can guide future app development decisions.

📊 Datasets Used

The analysis is based on two publicly available datasets from Kaggle:
